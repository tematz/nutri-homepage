# Nutri Homepage

Welcome to the Nutri Homepage project! This is an amazing website developed for a nutritionist dedicated to promoting healthy eating habits. I used technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create an engaging experience.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different devices, providing a consistent experience on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Dynamic Animations:** Carefully designed animations have been implemented to make navigation more captivating and immersive.

- **Fixed WhatsApp Button:** I've made it easy for users to contact the nutritionist directly. The WhatsApp button is always visible, allowing users to start a conversation with just one click.
